                            MISP core format
                                draft-17

Abstract

   This document describes the MISP core format used to exchange
   indicators and threat information between MISP (Open Source Threat
   Intelligence Sharing Platform formerly known as Malware Information
   Sharing Platform) instances.  The JSON format includes the overall
   structure along with the semantic associated for each respective key.
   The format is described to support other implementations which reuse
   the format and ensuring an interoperability with existing MISP
   [MISP-P] software and other Threat Intelligence Platforms.

1.  Introduction

   Sharing threat information became a fundamental requirements in the
   Internet, security and intelligence community at large.  Threat
   information can include indicators of compromise, malicious file
   indicators, financial fraud indicators or even detailed information
   about a threat actor.  MISP [MISP-P] started as an open source
   project in late 2011 and the MISP format started to be widely used as
   an exchange format within the community in the past years.  The aim
   of this document is to describe the specification and the MISP core
   format.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Format

2.1.  Overview

   The MISP core format is in the JSON [RFC8259] format.  In MISP, an
   event is composed of a single JSON object.

   A capitalized key (like Event, Org) represent a data model and a non-
   capitalised key is just an attribute.  This nomenclature can support
   an implementation to represent the MISP format in another data
   structure.

2.2.  Event

   An event is a simple meta structure scheme where attributes and meta-
   data are embedded to compose a coherent set of indicators.  An event
   can be composed from an incident, a security analysis report or a
   specific threat actor analysis.  The meaning of an event only depends
   of the information embedded in the event.

   Attributes are based on the usage within their different communities.
   Attributes can be extended on a regular basis and this reference
   document is updated accordingly.

2.3.2.4.  category

   category represents the intent of what the attribute is describing as
   selected by the attribute creator, using a list of pre-defined
   attribute categories.

   category is represented as a JSON string. category MUST be present
   and it MUST be a valid selection for the chosen type.  The list of
   valid category-type combinations is mentioned above.

2.3.2.5.  to_ids

   to_ids represents whether the attribute is meant to be actionable.
   Actionable defined attributes that can be used in automated processes
   as a pattern for detection in Local or Network Intrusion Detection
   System, log analysis tools or even filtering mechanisms.

   to_ids is represented as a JSON boolean. to_ids MUST be present.

2.3.2.6.  event_id

   event_id represents a human-readable identifier referencing the Event
   object that the attribute belongs to.  A human-readable identifier
   MUST be represented as an unsigned integer.

Internet-Draft              MISP core format               December 2024


   The event_id SHOULD be updated when the event is imported to reflect
   the newly created event's id on the instance.

   event_id is represented as a JSON string. event_id MUST be present.

2.3.2.7.  distribution

   distribution represents the basic distribution rules of the
   attribute.  The system must adhere to the distribution setting for
   access control and for dissemination of the attribute.

   distribution is represented by a JSON string. distribution MUST be
   present and be one of the following options:

   0  Your Organisation Only
   1  This Community Only
   2  Connected Communities
   3  All Communities
   4  Sharing Group
   5  Inherit Event

2.3.2.8.  timestamp

   timestamp represents a reference time when the attribute was created
   or last modified. timestamp is expressed in seconds (decimal) since
   1st of January 1970 (Unix timestamp).  The time zone MUST be UTC.

   timestamp is represented as a JSON string. timestamp MUST be present.

2.3.2.9.  comment

   comment is a contextual comment field.

   comment is represented by a JSON string. comment MAY be present.

2.3.2.10.  sharing_group_id

   sharing_group_id represents a human-readable identifier referencing a
   Sharing Group object that defines the distribution of the attribute,
   if distribution level "4" is set.  A human-readable identifier MUST
   be represented as an unsigned integer.

   sharing_group_id is represented by a JSON string and SHOULD be
   present.  If a distribution level other than "4" is chosen the
   sharing_group_id MUST be set to "0".

2.3.2.11.  deleted

   deleted represents a setting that allows attributes to be revoked.
   Revoked attributes are not actionable and exist merely to inform
   other instances of a revocation.

   deleted is represented by a JSON boolean. deleted MUST be present.

2.3.2.12.  data

   data contains the base64 encoded contents of an attachment or a
   malware sample.  For malware samples, the sample MUST be encrypted
   using a password protected zip archive, with the password being
   "infected".

   data is represented by a JSON string in base64 encoding. data MUST be
   set for attributes of type malware-sample and attachment.

2.3.2.13.  RelatedAttribute

   RelatedAttribute is an array of attributes correlating with the
   current attribute.  Each element in the array represents an JSON
   object which contains an Attribute dictionnary with the external
   attributes who correlate.  Each Attribute MUST include the id,
   org_id, info and a value.  Only the correlations found on the local
   instance are shown in RelatedAttribute.

   RelatedAttribute MAY be present.

2.3.2.14.  ShadowAttribute

   ShadowAttribute is an array of shadow attributes that serve as
   proposals by third parties to alter the containing attribute.  The
   structure of a ShadowAttribute is similar to that of an Attribute,
   which can be accepted or discarded by the event creator.  If
   accepted, the original attribute containing the shadow attribute is
   removed and the shadow attribute is converted into an attribute.

   Each shadow attribute that references an attribute MUST contain the
   containing attribute's ID in the old_id field and the event's ID in
   the event_id field.

2.3.2.15.  value

   value represents the payload of an attribute.  The format of the
   value is dependent on the type of the attribute.

   value is represented by a JSON string. value MUST be present.

2.3.2.16.  first_seen

   first_seen represents a reference time when the attribute was first
   seen. first_seen is expressed as an ISO 8601 datetime up to the
   micro-second with time zone support.

   first_seen is represented as a JSON string. first_seen MAY be
   present.

2.3.2.17.  last_seen

   last_seen represents a reference time when the attribute was last
   seen. last_seen is expressed as an ISO 8601 datetime up to the micro-
   second with time zone support.

   last_seen is represented as a JSON string. last_seen MAY be present.

2.4.  ShadowAttribute

   ShadowAttributes are 3rd party created attributes that either propose
   to add new information to an event or modify existing information.
   They are not meant to be actionable until the event creator accepts
   them - at which point they will be converted into attributes or
   modify an existing attribute.

   They are similar in structure to Attributes but additionally carry a
   reference to the creator of the ShadowAttribute as well as a
   revocation flag.

   within an event.  Their main purpose is to describe more complex
   structures than can be described by a single attribute Each object is
   created using an Object Template and carries the meta-data of the
   template used for its creation within.  Objects belong to a meta-
   category and are defined by a name.

   The schema used is described by the template_uuid and
   template_version fields.

   A MISP document containing an Object MUST contain a name, a meta-
   category, a description, a template_uuid and a template_version as
   described in the "Object Attributes" section.

   of the Sharing Group associated for the distribution.

   sharing_group_id is represented by a JSON string. sharing_group_id
   MUST be present and set to "0" if not used.

2.7.8.  timestamp

   timestamp represents a reference time when the EventReport was
   created or last modified. timestamp is expressed in seconds (decimal)
   since 1st of January 1970 (Unix timestamp).  The time zone MUST be
   UTC.

   timestamp is represented as a JSON string. timestamp MUST be present.

2.7.9.  deleted

   deleted represents a setting that allows EventReport to be revoked.
   Revoked EventReport are not actionable and exist merely to inform
   other instances of a revocation.

   deleted is represented by a JSON boolean. deleted MUST be present.

2.8.  Tag

   A tag is a simple method to classify an event with a simple string.
   The tag name can be freely chosen.  The tag name can be also chosen
   from a fixed machine-tag vocabulary called MISP taxonomies[[MISP-T]].
   When an event is distributed outside an organisation, the use of MISP
   taxonomies[[MISP-T]] is RECOMMENDED to ensure a coherent naming of
   the tags.  A tag is represented as a JSON array where each element
   describes each tag associated.  A tag array SHALL be at event level
   or attribute level.  A tag element is described with a name, id,
   colour and exportable flag.

   exportable represents a setting if the tag is kept local or
   exportable to other MISP instances. exportable is represented by a
   JSON boolean. id is a human-readable identifier that references the
   tag on the local instance. colour represents an RGB value of the tag.

   name MUST be present. colour, id and exportable SHALL be present.

2.9.  Sighting

   A sighting is an ascertainment which describes whether an attribute
   has been seen under a given set of conditions.  The sighting can
   include the organisation who sighted the attribute or can be
   anonymised.  Sighting is composed of a JSON array in which each
   element describes one singular instance of a sighting.  A sighting
   element is a JSON object composed of the following values:

   type MUST be present. type describes the type of a sighting.  MISP
   allows 3 default types:

       +===============+==========================================+
       | Sighting type |               Description                |
       +===============+==========================================+
       | 0             | denotes an attribute which has been seen |
       +---------------+------------------------------------------+
       | 1             | denotes an attribute which has been seen |
       |               |     and confirmed as false-positive      |
       +---------------+------------------------------------------+
       | 2             |    denotes an attribute which will be    |
       |               |   expired at the time of the sighting    |
       +---------------+------------------------------------------+
       | 3             | denotes an attribute which has been seen |
       |               |     and confirmed as a true-positive     |
       +---------------+------------------------------------------+

                                 Table 1

   uuid MUST be present. uuid references the uuid of the sighted
   attribute.

   date_sighting MUST be present. date_sighting is expressed in seconds
   (decimal) elapsed since 1st of January 1970 (Unix timestamp).

   source MAY be present. source is represented as a JSON string and
   represents the human-readable version of the sighting source, which
   can be a given piece of software (e.g.  SIEM), device or a specific
   analytical process.

   id, event_id and attribute_id are represented as a JSON string and
   MAY be present.

   id represents the human-readable identifier of the sighting reference
   which belongs to a specific MISP instance. event_id represents the
   human-readable identifier of the event referenced by the sighting and
   belongs to a specific MISP instance. attribute_id represents the
   human-readable identifier of the attribute referenced by the sighting
   and belongs to a specific MISP instance.

   org_id MAY be present along the JSON object describing the
   organisation.  If the org_id is not present, the sighting is
   considered as anonymised.

   org_id represents the human-readable identifier of the organisation
   which did the sighting and belongs to a specific MISP instance.

   A human-readable identifier MUST be considered as an unsigned
   integer.

2.11.  Analyst Data

   Analyst Data are objects that can take different forms within the
   MISP format, including objects, attributes, events, or detached
   formats from the MISP core.  They can express an Opinion, Note, or a
   Relationship from an analyst.  These three types define the key
   components of analyst data and can be applied at various levels
   within the data structure.  Analyst data can also be linked to
   provide additional complementary analysis on itself.

4.  Manifest

   MISP events can be shared over an HTTP repository, a file package or
   USB key.  A manifest file is used to provide an index of MISP events
   allowing to only fetch the recently updated files without the need to
   parse each json file.

4.1.  Format

   A manifest file is a simple JSON file named manifest.json in a
   directory where the MISP events are located.  Each MISP event is a
   file located in the same directory with the event uuid as filename
   with the json extension.

   The manifest format is a JSON object composed of a dictionary where
   the field is the uuid of the event.

   Each uuid is composed of a JSON object with the following fields
   which came from the original event referenced by the same uuid:

   *  info (MUST)
   *  Orgc object (MUST)
   *  analysis (SHALL)
   *  timestamp (MUST)
   *  date (MUST)
   *  threat_level_id (SHALL)

   In addition to the fields originating from the event, the following
   fields can be added:

   *  integrity:sha256 represents the SHA256 value in hexadecimal
      representation of the associated MISP event file to ensure
      integrity of the file.  (SHOULD)
   *  integrity:pgp represents a detached PGP signature [RFC4880] of the
      associated MISP event file to ensure integrity of the file.
      (SHOULD)

   If a detached PGP signature is used for each MISP event, a detached
   PGP signature is a MUST to ensure integrity of the manifest file.  A
   detached PGP signature for a manifest file is a manifest.json.asc
   file containing the PGP signature.

5.  Implementation

   MISP format is implemented by different software including the MISP
   threat sharing platform and libraries like PyMISP [MISP-P].
   Implementations use the format as an export/import mechanism, staging
   transport format or synchronisation format as used in the MISP core
   platform.  MISP format doesn't impose any restriction on the data
   representation of the format in data-structure of other
   implementations.

6.  Security Considerations

   MISP events might contain sensitive or confidential information.
   Adequate access control and encryption measures shall be implemented
   to ensure the confidentiality of the MISP events.

   Adversaries might include malicious content in MISP events and
   attributes.  Implementation MUST consider the input of malicious
   inputs beside the standard threat information that might already
   include malicious intended inputs.
