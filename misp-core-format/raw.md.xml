<abstract>
<t>This document describes the MISP core format used to exchange indicators and threat information between
MISP (Open Source Threat Intelligence Sharing Platform formerly known as Malware Information Sharing Platform) instances.
The JSON format includes the overall structure along with the semantic associated for each
respective key. The format is described to support other implementations which reuse the
format and ensuring an interoperability with existing MISP <xref target="MISP-P"></xref> software and other Threat Intelligence Platforms.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>Sharing threat information became a fundamental requirements in the Internet, security and intelligence community at large. Threat
information can include indicators of compromise, malicious file indicators, financial fraud indicators
or even detailed information about a threat actor. MISP <xref target="MISP-P"></xref> started as an open source project in late 2011 and
the MISP format started to be widely used as an exchange format within the community in the past years. The aim of this document
is to describe the specification and the MISP core format.</t>

<section anchor="conventions-and-terminology"><name>Conventions and Terminology</name>
<t>The key words &quot;<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>&quot;, &quot;<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>&quot;, &quot;<bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>&quot;, &quot;<bcp14>SHALL</bcp14>&quot;, &quot;<bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14>&quot;,

<section anchor="overview"><name>Overview</name>
<t>The MISP core format is in the JSON <xref target="RFC8259"></xref> format. In MISP, an event is composed of a single JSON object.</t>
<t>A capitalized key (like Event, Org) represent a data model and a non-capitalised key is just an attribute. This nomenclature
can support an implementation to represent the MISP format in another data structure.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="event"><name>Event</name>
<t>An event is a simple meta structure scheme where attributes and meta-data are embedded to compose a coherent set
of indicators. An event can be composed from an incident, a security analysis report or a specific threat actor

<t>RelatedAttribute <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be present.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="shadowattribute"><name>ShadowAttribute</name>
<t>ShadowAttribute is an array of shadow attributes that serve as proposals by third parties to alter the containing attribute. The structure of a ShadowAttribute is similar to that of an Attribute,
which can be accepted or discarded by the event creator. If accepted, the original attribute containing the shadow attribute is removed and the shadow attribute is converted into an attribute.</t>
<t>Each shadow attribute that references an attribute <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the containing attribute's ID in the old_id field and the event's ID in the event_id field.</t>
</section>

</section>

<section anchor="shadowattribute-1"><name>ShadowAttribute</name>
<t>ShadowAttributes are 3rd party created attributes that either propose to add new information to an event or modify existing information. They are not meant to be actionable until the event creator accepts them - at which point they will be converted into attributes or modify an existing attribute.</t>
<t>They are similar in structure to Attributes but additionally carry a reference to the creator of the ShadowAttribute as well as a revocation flag.</t>

<t>MISP events can be shared over an HTTP repository, a file package or USB key. A manifest file is used to
provide an index of MISP events allowing to only fetch the recently updated files without the need to parse
each json file.</t>

<section anchor="format-1"><name>Format</name>
<t>A manifest file is a simple JSON file named manifest.json in a directory where the MISP events are located.
Each MISP event is a file located in the same directory with the event uuid as filename with the json extension.</t>
<t>The manifest format is a JSON object composed of a dictionary where the field is the uuid of the event.</t>
<t>Each uuid is composed of a JSON object with the following fields which came from the original event referenced
by the same uuid:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>info (<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>)</li>
<li>Orgc object (<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>)</li>
<li>analysis (<bcp14>SHALL</bcp14>)</li>
<li>timestamp (<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>)</li>
<li>date (<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>)</li>
<li>threat_level_id (<bcp14>SHALL</bcp14>)</li>
</ul>
<t>In addition to the fields originating from the event, the following fields can be added:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>integrity:sha256 represents the SHA256 value in hexadecimal representation of the associated MISP event file to ensure integrity of the file. (<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>)</li>
<li>integrity:pgp represents a detached PGP signature <xref target="RFC4880"></xref> of the associated MISP event file to ensure integrity of the file. (<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>)</li>
</ul>
<t>If a detached PGP signature is used for each MISP event, a detached PGP signature is a <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> to ensure integrity of the manifest file.
A detached PGP signature for a manifest file is a manifest.json.asc file containing the PGP signature.</t>

<section anchor="implementation"><name>Implementation</name>
<t>MISP format is implemented by different software including the MISP threat sharing
platform and libraries like PyMISP <xref target="MISP-P"></xref>. Implementations use the format
as an export/import mechanism, staging transport format or synchronisation format
as used in the MISP core platform. MISP format doesn't impose any restriction on
the data representation of the format in data-structure of other implementations.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>
<t>MISP events might contain sensitive or confidential information. Adequate
access control and encryption measures shall be implemented to ensure
the confidentiality of the MISP events.</t>
<t>Adversaries might include malicious content in MISP events and attributes.
Implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> consider the input of malicious inputs beside the
standard threat information that might already include malicious intended inputs.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="acknowledgements"><name>Acknowledgements</name>
<t>The authors wish to thank all the MISP community who are supporting the creation
of open standards in threat intelligence sharing. A special thank to Nicolas Bareil
for the review of the JSON Schema.</t>
