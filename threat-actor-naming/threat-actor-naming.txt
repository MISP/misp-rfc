                Recommendations on Naming Threat Actors
                                draft-00

Abstract

   This document provides advice on the naming of threat actors (also
   known as malicious actors).  The objective is to provide practical
   advice for organizations such as security vendors or organizations
   attributing incidents to a group of threat actors.  It also discusses
   the implications of naming a threat actor for intelligence analysts
   and threat intelligence platforms such as MISP [MISP-P].

1.  Introduction

   In threat intelligence, a name can be assigned to a threat actor
   without specific guidelines.  This leads to issues such as:

   *  A proliferation of threat actor names generating overlaps or
      different names for similar threat actors (e.g., some threat
      actors have more than 10 synonyms).
   *  Ambiguity in the words used to name the threat actor in different
      contexts (e.g., using common words).
   *  Lack of a clearly defined text format to describe the same threat
      actor (e.g., Is the threat actor name case-sensitive?  Is there a
      dash or a space between the words?).
   *  Confusion between techniques/tools used by a threat actor versus
      its name (e.g., naming a threat actor after a specific malware
      used).
   *  Lack of source and reasoning from vendors when they describe their
      threat actor names (e.g., did they name the threat actor after a
      specific set of campaigns or a specific set of targets?).
   *  Lack of time-based information about the threat actor name, such
      as date of naming or a UUID.
   *  Lack of an open, mirrored "registry" of reference, accessible to
      all, where a new threat actor name can be registered, or where all
      already named threat actors can be accessed.  The "registry" can
      contain the time-based information mentioned above; it is a tool.

   This document proposes a set of guidelines for naming threat actors.
   The goal is to reduce the issues mentioned above.

Internet-Draft   Recommendations on Naming Threat Actors   December 2024


1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Recommendations

   The recommendations listed below provide a minimal set of guidelines
   when assigning a new name to a threat actor.

2.1.  Reusing Threat Actor Names

   Before creating a new threat actor name, you MUST consider a review
   of existing threat actor names from databases such as the threat
   actor MISP galaxy [MISP-G].  Proliferation of threat actor names is a
   significant challenge for day-to-day analyst work.  If your defined
   threat actor matches an existing threat actor, you MUST reuse an
   existing threat actor name.  If there is no matching threat actor
   name, you SHALL create a new threat actor name, following the best
   practices defined in this document.

2.2.  Uniqueness

   When choosing a threat actor name, uniqueness is a critical property.
   The threat actor name MUST be unique and not already in use in
   different contexts.  The name MUST NOT be a word from a dictionary,
   which could be used in other contexts.

2.3.  Format

   The name of the threat actor SHALL be composed of a single word.  If
   there are multiple parts, such as a decimal value or a counter, the
   values MUST be separated with a dash.  Single words are preferred to
   ease keyword searches by analysts in public sources.

2.4.  Encoding

   The name of the threat actor MUST be expressed in 7-bit ASCII.
   Assigning a localized name to a threat actor MAY create ambiguity due
   to different localized versions of the same threat actor.

2.5.  Avoid Confusing Actor Names with Malware Names

   The name of the threat actor MUST NOT be based on the tools,
   techniques, or patterns used by the threat actor.  A notorious
   example in the threat intelligence community is Turla, which can
   refer to a threat actor but also to a malware used by this group or
   other groups.

2.6.  Directory

   A reference registry of threat actors is RECOMMENDED to ensure
   consistency of names accross different parties such as the threat
   actor MISP galaxy [MISP-G].

3.  Examples

   Some known examples are included below and serve as references for
   good and bad practices in naming threat actors.  The following threat
   actor names are considered good examples:

   *  APT-1
   *  TA-505

   The following threat actor names are considered examples to avoid:

   *  GIF89a (Word also used for the GIF header)
   *  ShadyRAT (Confusion between the name and the tool)
   *  Group 3 (Common name used for other use-cases)
   *  ZooPark (Name is used to describe something else)

4.  Security Considerations

   Naming a threat actor could include sensitive references to a case or
   an incident.  Before releasing a name, the creator MUST review the
   name to ensure no sensitive information is included in the threat
   actor name.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors wish to thank all contributors who provided feedback
   through the now-defunct Twitter and other new social networks.
