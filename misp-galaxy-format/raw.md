.# Abstract

This document describes the MISP galaxy format which describes a simple JSON format to represent galaxies and clusters that can be attached to MISP events or attributes. A public directory of MISP galaxies is available and relies on the MISP galaxy format. MISP galaxies are used to add further informations on a MISP event. MISP galaxy is a public repository [@?MISP-G] [@?MISP-G-DOC] of known malware, threats actors and various other collections of data that can be used to mark, classify or label data in threat information sharing.

# Introduction

Sharing threat information became a fundamental requirements on the Internet, security and intelligence community at large. Threat information can include indicators of compromise, malicious file indicators, financial fraud indicators or even detailed information about a threat actor. Some of these informations, such as malware or threat actors are common to several security events. MISP galaxy is a public repository [@?MISP-G] of known malware, threats actors and various other collections of data that can be used to mark, classify or label data in threat information sharing.

In the MISP galaxy context, clusters help analysts to give more informations about their cybersecurity events, indicators or threats. MISP galaxies can be used for classification, filtering, triggering actions or visualisation depending on their use in threat intelligence platforms such as MISP [@?MISP-P].

##  Conventions and Terminology

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**",
"**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [@!RFC2119].

# Format

A cluster is composed of a value (**MUST**), a uuid (**MUST**), a description (**MUST**) and metadata (**OPTIONAL**).

Clusters are represented as a JSON [@!RFC8259] dictionary.

## Overview

The MISP galaxy format uses the JSON [@!RFC8259] format. Each galaxy is represented as a JSON object with meta information including the following fields: name, uuid, description, version, type, authors, source, values, category.

name defines the name of the galaxy. The name is represented as a string and **MUST** be present. The uuid represents the Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) [@!RFC4122] of the object reference. The uuid **MUST** be preserved. For any updates or transfer of the same object reference. UUID version 4 is **RECOMMENDED** when assigning it to a new object reference and **MUST** be present. The description is represented as a string and **MUST** be present. The uuid is represented as a string and **MUST** be present. The version is represented as a decimal and **MUST** be present. The type is represented as a string and **MUST** be present and **MUST** match the name of the galaxy file. The source is represented as a string and **MUST** be present. Authors are represented as an array containing one or more authors and **MUST** be present. The category is represented as a string and **MUST** be present and describes the overall category of the galaxy such as tool or actor.

Values are represented as an array containing one or more values and **MUST** be present. Values defines all values available in the galaxy.

## values

The values array contains one or more JSON objects which represent all the possible values in the galaxy. The JSON object contains four fields: value, description, uuid and meta.
The value is represented as a string and **MUST** be present. The description is represented as a string and **SHOULD** be present. The meta or metadata is represented as a JSON list and **SHOULD** be present.
The uuid represents the Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) [@!RFC4122] of the value reference. The uuid **MUST** be present and **MUST** be preserved.

## related

Related contains a list of JSON key value pairs which describe the related values in this galaxy cluster or to other galaxy clusters. The JSON object contains three fields, dest-uuid, type and tags. The dest-uuid represents the target UUID which encompasses a relation of some type. The dest-uuid is represented as a string and **MUST** be present. The type is represented as a string and **MUST** be present and **SHOULD** be selected from the relationship types available in MISP objects [@?MISP-R].  The tags is a list of string which labels the related relationship such as the level of similarities, level of certainty, trust or confidence in the relationship, false-positive. A tag is represented in machine tag format which is a string an **SHOULD** be present.

## meta

Meta contains a list of custom defined JSON key value pairs. Users **SHOULD** reuse commonly used keys such as complexity, effectiveness, country, external_id, possible_issues, colour, motive, impact, refs, synonyms, status, date, encryption, extensions, ransomnotes, ransomnotes-filenames, ransomnotes-refs, suspected-victims, suspected-state-sponsor, type-of-incident, target-category, cfr-suspected-victims, cfr-suspected-state-sponsor, cfr-type-of-incident, cfr-target-category, suspected-victims, suspected-state-sponsor, attribution-confidence, payment-method, price, spoken-language, official-refs wherever applicable. Additional meta field **MAY** be added without the need to be referenced or registered in advance.

refs, synonyms, official-refs **SHALL** be used to give further informations. refs is represented as an array containing one or more strings and **SHALL** be present. synonyms is represented as an array containing one or more strings and **SHALL** be present. official-refs is represented as an array containing one or more strings and **MAY** be present.

date, status **MAY** be used to give time information about an cluster. date is represented as a string describing a time or period and **SHALL** be present. status is represented as a string describing the current status of the clusters. It **MAY** also describe a time or period and **SHALL** be present.

colour fields **MAY** be used at predicates or values level to set a specify colour that **MAY** be used by the implementation. The colour field is described as an RGB colour fill in hexadecimal representation.

complexity, effectiveness, impact, possible_issues **MAY** be used to give further information in preventive-measure galaxy. complexity is represented by an enumerated value from a fixed vocabulary and **SHALL** be present. effectiveness is represented by an enumerated value from a fixed vocabulary and **SHALL** be present. impact is represented by an enumerated value from a fixed vocabulary and **SHALL** be present. possible_issues is represented as a string and **SHOULD** be present.
