                                draft-08

Abstract

   This document describes the MISP galaxy format which describes a
   simple JSON format to represent galaxies and clusters that can be
   attached to MISP events or attributes.  A public directory of MISP
   galaxies is available and relies on the MISP galaxy format.  MISP
   galaxies are used to add further informations on a MISP event.  MISP
   galaxy is a public repository [MISP-G] [MISP-G-DOC] of known malware,
   threats actors and various other collections of data that can be used
   to mark, classify or label data in threat information sharing.

1.  Introduction

   Sharing threat information became a fundamental requirements on the
   Internet, security and intelligence community at large.  Threat
   information can include indicators of compromise, malicious file
   indicators, financial fraud indicators or even detailed information
   about a threat actor.  Some of these informations, such as malware or
   threat actors are common to several security events.  MISP galaxy is
   a public repository [MISP-G] of known malware, threats actors and
   various other collections of data that can be used to mark, classify
   or label data in threat information sharing.

   In the MISP galaxy context, clusters help analysts to give more
   informations about their cybersecurity events, indicators or threats.
   MISP galaxies can be used for classification, filtering, triggering
   actions or visualisation depending on their use in threat
   intelligence platforms such as MISP [MISP-P].

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Format

   A cluster is composed of a value (MUST), a description (OPTIONAL) and
   metadata (OPTIONAL).

   Clusters are represented as a JSON [RFC8259] dictionary.

2.1.  Overview

   The MISP galaxy format uses the JSON [RFC8259] format.  Each galaxy
   is represented as a JSON object with meta information including the
   following fields: name, uuid, description, version, type, authors,
   source, values, category.

   name defines the name of the galaxy.  The name is represented as a
   string and MUST be present.  The uuid represents the Universally
   Unique IDentifier (UUID) [RFC4122] of the object reference.  The uuid
   MUST be preserved.  For any updates or transfer of the same object
   reference.  UUID version 4 is RECOMMENDED when assigning it to a new
   object reference and MUST be present.  The description is represented
   as a string and MUST be present.  The uuid is represented as a string
   and MUST be present.  The version is represented as a decimal and
   MUST be present.  The type is represented as a string and MUST be
   present and MUST match the name of the galaxy file.  The source is
   represented as a string and MUST be present.  Authors are represented
   as an array containing one or more authors and MUST be present.  The
   category is represented as a string and MUST be present and describes
   the overall category of the galaxy such as tool or actor.

   Values are represented as an array containing one or more values and
   MUST be present.  Values defines all values available in the galaxy.

2.2.  values

   The values array contains one or more JSON objects which represent
   all the possible values in the galaxy.  The JSON object contains four
   fields: value, description, uuid and meta.  The value is represented
   as a string and MUST be present.  The description is represented as a
   string and SHOULD be present.  The meta or metadata is represented as
   a JSON list and SHOULD be present.  The uuid represents the
   Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) [RFC4122] of the value
   reference.  The uuid SHOULD can be present and MUST be preserved.

2.3.  related

   Related contains a list of JSON key value pairs which describe the
   related values in this galaxy cluster or to other galaxy clusters.
   The JSON object contains three fields, dest-uuid, type and tags.  The
   dest-uuid represents the target UUID which encompasses a relation of
   some type.  The dest-uuid is represented as a string and MUST be
   present.  The type is represented as a string and MUST be present and
   SHOULD be selected from the relationship types available in MISP
   objects [MISP-R].  The tags is a list of string which labels the
   related relationship such as the level of similarities, level of
   certainty, trust or confidence in the relationship, false-positive.

   A tag is represented in machine tag format which is a string an
   SHOULD be present.

  "type": "similar",
  "tags": ["estimative-language:likelihood-probability=\"very-likely\""]
} ]

2.4.  meta

   Meta contains a list of custom defined JSON key value pairs.  Users
   SHOULD reuse commonly used keys such as complexity, effectiveness,
   country, external_id, possible_issues, colour, motive, impact, refs,
   synonyms, status, date, encryption, extensions, ransomnotes,
   ransomnotes-filenames, ransomnotes-refs, suspected-victims,

   status of the clusters.  It MAY also describe a time or period and
   SHALL be present.

   colour fields MAY be used at predicates or values level to set a
   specify colour that MAY be used by the implementation.  The colour
   field is described as an RGB colour fill in hexadecimal
   representation.

   complexity, effectiveness, impact, possible_issues MAY be used to
   give further information in preventive-measure galaxy. complexity is
   represented by an enumerated value from a fixed vocabulary and SHALL
   be present. effectiveness is represented by an enumerated value from
   a fixed vocabulary and SHALL be present. impact is represented by an
   enumerated value from a fixed vocabulary and SHALL be present.
