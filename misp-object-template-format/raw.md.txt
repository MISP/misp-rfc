                                draft-06

Abstract

   This document describes the MISP object template format which
   describes a simple JSON format to represent the various templates
   used to construct MISP objects.  A public directory of common
   vocabularies MISP object templates [MISP-O] is available and relies
   on the MISP object reference format.

1.  Introduction

   Due to the increased maturity of threat information sharing, the need
   arose for more complex and exhaustive data-points to be shared across
   the various sharing communities.  MISP's information sharing in
   general relied on a flat structure of attributes contained within an
   event, where attributes served as atomic secluded data-points with
   some commonalities as defined by the encapsulating event.  However,
   this flat structure restricted the use of more diverse and complex
   data-points described by a list of atomic values, a problem solved by
   the MISP object structure.

   MISP objects combine a list of attributes to represent a singular
   object with various facets.  In order to bootstrap the object
   creation process and to maintain uniformity among objects describing
   similar data-points, the MISP object template format serves as a
   reusable and share-able blueprint format.

   MISP object templates also include a vocabulary to describe the
   various inter object and object to attribute relationships and are
   leveraged by MISP object references.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft         MISP object template format         December 2023


2.  Format

   MISP object templates are composed of the MISP object template (MUST)
   structure itself and a list of MISP object template elements (SHOULD)
   describing the list of possible attributes belonging to the resulting
   object, along with their context and settings.

   MISP object templates themselves consist of a name (MUST), a meta-
   category (MUST) and a description (SHOULD).  They are identified by a
   uuid (MUST) and a version (MUST).  For any updates or transfer of the
   same object reference.  UUID version 4 is RECOMMENDED when assigning
   it to a new object reference.  The list of requirements when it comes
   to the contained MISP object template elements is defined in the
   requirements field (OPTIONAL).

   MISP object template elements consist of an object_relation (MUST), a
   type (MUST), an object_template_id (SHOULD), a ui_priority (SHOULD),
   a list of categories (MAY), a list of sane_default values (MAY) or a
   values_list (MAY).

2.1.  Overview

   The MISP object template format uses the JSON [RFC8259] format.  Each
   template is represented as a JSON object with meta information
   including the following fields: uuid, requiredOneOf, description,
   version, meta-category, name.

2.1.1.  Object Template

2.1.1.1.  uuid

   uuid represents the Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) [RFC4122] of
   the object template.  The uuid MUST be preserved for to keep
   consistency of the templates across instances.  UUID version 4 is
   RECOMMENDED when assigning it to a new object template.

   uuid is represented as a JSON string. uuid MUST be present.

2.1.1.2.  requiredOneOf

   requiredOneOf is represented as a JSON list and contains a list of
   attribute relationships of which one must be present in the object to
   be created based on the given template.  The requiredOneOf field MAY
   be present.

2.1.1.3.  required

   required is represented as a JSON list and contains a list of
   attribute relationships of which all must be present in the object to
   be created based on the given template.  The required field MAY be
   present.

2.1.1.4.  description

   description is represented as a JSON string and contains the assigned
   meaning given to objects created using this template.  The
   description field MUST be present.

2.1.1.5.  version

   version represents a numeric incrementing version of the object
   template.  It is used to associate the object to the correct version
   of the template and together with the uuid field forms an association
   to the correct template type and version.

   version is represented as a JSON string. version MUST be present.

2.1.1.6.  meta-category

   meta-category represents the sub-category of objects that the given
   object template belongs to. meta-categories are not tied to a fixed
   list of options but can be created on the fly.

   meta-category is represented as a JSON string. meta-category MUST be
   present.

2.1.1.7.  name

   name represents the human-readable name of the objects created using
   the given template, describing the intent of the object package.

   name is represented as a JSON string. name MUST be present

2.1.2.  attributes

   attributes is represented as a JSON list and contains a list of
   template elements used as a template for creating the individual
   attributes within the object that is to be created with the object.

   attributes is represented as a JSON list. attributes MUST be present.

2.1.2.1.  description

   description is represented as a JSON string and contains the
   description of the given attribute in the context of the object with
   the given relationship.  The description field MUST be present.

2.1.2.2.  ui-priority

   ui-priority is represented by a numeric values in JSON string format
   and is meant to provide a priority for the given element in the
   object template visualisation.  The ui-priority MAY be present.

2.1.2.3.  misp-attribute

   misp-attribute is represented by a JSON string or a JSON object with
   a list of values.  The value(s) are taken from the pool of types
   defined by the MISP core format's Attribute Object's type list. type
   can contain a JSON object with a list of suggested value alternatives
   encapsulated in a list within a sane_default key or a list of
   enforced value alternatives encapsulated in a list_values key.

   The misp-attribute field MUST be present.

2.1.2.4.  disable_correlation

   disable_correlation is represented by a JSON boolean.  The
   disable_correlation field flags the attribute(s) created by the given
   object template element to be marked as non correlating.

   The misp-attribute field MAY be present.

2.1.2.5.  categories

   categories is represented by a JSON list containing one or several
   valid options from the list of verbs valid for the category field in
   the Attribute object within the MISP core format.

   The categories field MAY be present.

2.1.2.6.  multiple

   multiple is represented by a JSON boolean value.  It marks the MISP
   object template element as a multiple input field, allowing for
   several attributes to be created by the element within the same
   object.

   The multiple field MAY be present.

      capture multiple Campaigns or other activities that are all tied
      together by shared attributes indicating a commonly known or
      unknown Threat Actor.  New activity can be attributed to an
      Intrusion Set even if the Threat Actors behind the attack are not

      known.  Threat Actors can move from supporting one Intrusion Set
      to supporting another, or they may support multiple Intrusion
      Sets.  Where a Campaign is a set of attacks over a period of time
      against a specific set of targets to achieve some objective, an
      Intrusion Set is the entire attack package and may be used over a
      very long period of time in multiple Campaigns to achieve
      potentially multiple purposes.  While sometimes an Intrusion Set
      is not active, or changes focus, it is usually difficult to know
      if it has truly disappeared or ended.  Analysts may have varying
      level of fidelity on attributing an Intrusion Set back to Threat
      Actors and may be able to only attribute it back to a nation state
      or perhaps back to an organization within that nation state.
