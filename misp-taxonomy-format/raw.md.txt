                          MISP taxonomy format
                                draft-11

Abstract

   This document outlines the MISP taxonomy format, a straightforward
   JSON structure designed to represent machine tags (also known as
   triple tags) vocabularies.  A public directory, referred to as MISP
   taxonomies, is available and leverages this format.  These taxonomies
   are used to classify cybersecurity events, threats, suspicious
   activities, and indicators.

1.  Introduction

   Sharing threat information has become a fundamental requirement in
   the Internet security and intelligence community at large.  This
   information can include indicators of compromise, malicious file
   indicators, financial fraud indicators, or even detailed information
   about a threat actor.  Classification plays a crucial role while
   sharing such indicators or information, ensuring adequate
   distribution, understanding, validation, or action regarding the
   shared information.  The MISP taxonomies are a public repository of
   known vocabularies that can be utilized in threat information
   sharing.

   Machine tags were introduced in 2007 [machine-tags] to allow users to
   be more precise when tagging their pictures with geolocation.  So a
   machine tag is a tag which uses a special syntax to provide more
   information to users and machines.  Machine tags are also known as
   triple tags due to their format.

   In the MISP taxonomy context, machine tags help analysts to classify
   their cybersecurity events, indicators or threats.  MISP taxonomies
   can be used for classification, filtering, triggering actions or
   visualisation depending on their use in threat intelligence platforms
   such as MISP [MISP-P].

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Format

   A machine tag is composed of a namespace (MUST), a predicate (MUST)
   and an optional value (OPTIONAL).

   Machine tags are represented as a string.  Below listed are a set of
   sample machine tags for different namespaces such as tlp, admiralty-
   scale and osint.

   tlp:amber
   admiralty-scale:information-credibility="1"
   osint:source-type="blog-post"

   The MISP taxonomy format describes how to define a machine tag
   namespace in a parseable format.  The objective is to provide a
   simple format to describe machine tag (aka triple tag) vocabularies.

2.1.  Overview

   The MISP taxonomy format uses the JSON [RFC8259] format.  Each
   namespace is represented as a JSON object with meta information
   including the following fields: namespace, description, version,
   type.

   namespace defines the overall namespace of the machine tag.  The
   namespace is represented as a string and MUST be present.  The
   description is represented as a string and MUST be present.  A
   version is represented as a unsigned integer MUST be present.  A type
   defines where a specific taxonomy is applicable and a type can be
   applicable at event, user or org level.  The type is represented as
   an array containing one or more type and SHOULD be present.  If a
   type is not mentioned, by default, the taxonomy is applicable at
   event level only.  An exclusive boolean property MAY be present and
   defines at namespace level if the predicates are mutually exclusive.

   predicates defines all the predicates available in the namespace
   defined. predicates is represented as an array of JSON objects.
   predicates MUST be present and MUST at least content one element.

   values defines all the values for each predicate in the namespace
   defined. values SHOULD be present.

2.2.  predicates

   The predicates array contains one or more JSON objects which lists
   all the possible predicates.  The JSON object contains two fields:
   value and expanded. value MUST be present. expanded SHOULD be
   present. value is represented as a string and describes the predicate
   value.  The predicate value MUST not contain spaces or colons.
   expanded is represented as a string and describes the human-readable
   version of the predicate value.  An exclusive property MAY be present
   and defines at namespace level if the values are mutually exclusive.

2.3.  values

   The values array contain one or more JSON objects which lists all the
   possible values of a predicate.  The JSON object contains two fields:
   predicate and entry. predicate is represented as a string and
   describes the predicate value. entry is an array with one or more
   JSON objects.  The JSON object contains two fields: value and
   expanded. value MUST be present. expanded SHOULD be present. value is
   represented as a string and describes the machine parsable value.
   expanded is represented as a string and describes the human-readable
   version of the value.

2.4.  uuid

   uuid represents the Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) [RFC4122] of
   the taxonomy.  The uuid MUST be preserved for any updates of the same
   taxonomy.  UUID version 4 or version 5 is RECOMMENDED when assigning
   it to a new taxonomy. uuid MUST be present at predicate and value
   level.

   uuid is represented as a JSON string. uuid MUST be present.

2.5.  optional fields

2.5.1.  colour

   colour fields MAY be used at predicates or values level to set a
   specify colour that MAY be used by the implementation.  The colour
   field is described as an RGB colour fill in hexadecimal
   representation.

   Example use of the colour field in the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP):

"predicates": [
    {
      "colour": "#FF2B2B",
      "description": "For the eyes and ears of individual recipients only, no further disclosure. Sources may use TLP:RED when information cannot be effectively acted upon without significant risk for the privacy, reputation, or operations of the organizations involved. Recipients may therefore not share TLP:RED information with anyone else. In the context of a meeting, for example, TLP:RED information is limited to those present at the meeting.",
      "expanded": "(TLP:RED) For the eyes and ears of individual recipients only, no further disclosure.",
      "value": "red",
      "uuid": "845de186-eefa-57a6-be53-a0d36b7c6d2e"
    },
    {
      "colour": "#FFC000",
      "description": "Limited disclosure, recipients can only spread this on a need-to-know basis within their organization and its clients. Sources may use TLP:AMBER when information requires support to be effectively acted upon, yet carries risk to privacy, reputation, or operations if shared outside of the organizations involved. Recipients may share TLP:AMBER information with members of their own organization and its clients, but only on a need-to-know basis to protect their organization and its clients and prevent further harm. Note that TLP:AMBER+STRICT restricts sharing to the organization only.",
      "expanded": "(TLP:AMBER) Limited disclosure, recipients can only spread this on a need-to-know basis within their organization and its clients.",
      "value": "amber",
      "uuid": "8906fac2-2d9c-55fd-af11-0f35e91a6347"
    }...]

2.5.2.  description

   description fields MAY be used at predicates or values level to add a
   descriptive and human-readable information about the specific
   predicate or value.  The field is represented as a string.
   Implementations MAY use the description field to improve more
   contextual information.  The description at the namespace level is a
   MUST as described above.

2.5.3.  numerical_value

   numerical_value fields MAY be used at a predicate or value level to
   add a machine-readable numeric value to a specific predicate or
   value.  The field is represented as a JSON number.  Implementations
   SHOULD use the decimal value provided to support scoring or
   filtering.

   The decimal range for numerical_value SHOULD use a range from 0 up to
   100.  The range is recommended to support common mathematical
   properties among taxonomies.

   Example use of the numerical_value in the MISP confidence level:

3.  Directory

   The MISP taxonomies directory is publicly available [MISP-T] in a git
   repository.  The repository contains a directory per namespace then a
   file machinetag.json which contains the taxonomy as described in the
   format above.  In the root of the repository, a MANIFEST.json exists
   containing a list of all the taxonomies.

   The MANIFEST.json file is composed of an JSON object with metadata
   like version, license, description, url and path.  A taxonomies array
   describes the taxonomy available with the description, name and
   version field.

      jointly tabulate both the of these failure modes in a single
      place.  Intentional failures wherein the failure is caused by an
      active adversary attempting to subvert the syst em to attain her
      goals – either to misclassify the result, infer private training
      data, or to steal the underlying algorithm.  Unintentional
      failures wherein the failure is because an ML system produces a
      formall y correct but completely unsafe outcome.
   false-positive:  This taxonomy aims to ballpark the expected amount
      of false positives.
