Abstract

   This document describes the MISP taxonomy format which describes a
   simple JSON format to represent machine tags (also called triple
   tags) vocabularies.  A public directory of common vocabularies MISP
   taxonomies is available and relies on the MISP taxonomy format.

1.  Introduction

   Sharing threat information became a fundamental requirements in the
   Internet, security and intelligence community at large.  Threat
   information can include indicators of compromise, malicious file
   indicators, financial fraud indicators or even detailed information
   about a threat actor.  While sharing such indicators or information,
   classification plays an important role to ensure adequate
   distribution, understanding, validation or action of the shared
   information.  MISP taxonomies is a public repository of known
   vocabularies that can be used in threat information sharing.

   Machine tags were introduced in 2007 [machine-tags] to allow users to
   be more precise when tagging their picture with geolocation.  So a
   machine tag is a tag which use a special syntax to provide more
   information to user and machines.  Machine tags are also known as
   triple tags due to the their format.

   In MISP taxonomy context, machine tags help analysts to classify
   their cybersecurity events, indicators or threats.  MISP taxonomy can
   be used for classification, filtering, triggering action or
   visualization depending on their use in threat intelligence platforms
   like MISP [MISP-P].

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Format

   A machine tag is composed of a namespace (MUST), a predicate (MUST)
   and an optional value (OPTIONAL).

   Machine tags are represented as a string.  Below a set of sample
   machine tags for different namespaces like tlp, admiralty-scale or
   osint.

                tlp:amber
                admiralty-scale:information-credibility="1"
                osint:source-type="blog-post"

   The MISP taxonomy format describes how to define a machine tag
   namespace in a parseable format.  The objective is to provide a
   simple format to describe machine tags (aka triple tags)
   vocabularies.

2.1.  Overview

   The MISP taxonomy format uses the JSON [RFC4627] format.  Each
   namespace is represented as a JSON object with meta information
   including the following fields namespace, description, version.

   namespace defines the overall namespace of the machine tag.  The
   namespace is represented as a string and MUST be present.  The
   description is represented as a string and SHOULD be present.  A
   version is represented as a decimal and MUST be present.

   predicates defines all the predicates available in the namespace
   defined. predicates is represented as an array of JSON objects.
   predicates MUST be present and MUST at least content one element.

   values defines all the values for each predicate in the namespace
   defined. values SHOULD ne present.

2.2.  predicates

   predicates array contain one or more JSON objects which lists all the
   possible predicate.  The JSON object contains two fields: value and
   expanded. value and expanded MUST be present. value is represented as
   a string and describes the predicate value.  The predicate value MUST

   not contain spaces or colons. expanded is represented as a string and
   describes the human-readable version of the predicate value.

2.3.  values

   values array contain one or more JSON objects which lists all the
   possible values of a predicate.  The JSON object contain two fields:
   predicate and entry. predicate is represented as a string and
   describes the predicate value. entry is an array with one or more
   JSON objects.  The JSON object contains two fields: value and
   expanded. value and expanded MUST be present. value is represented as
   a string and describe the value machine parsable. expanded is
   represented as a string and describes the human-readable version of
   the value.

2.4.  optional fields

2.4.1.  colour

   colour fields MAY be used at predicates or values level to set a
   specify colour that *MAY** be used by the implementation.  The colour
   field is described as an RGB colour fill in hexadecimal
   representation.

   Example use of the colour field in the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP):

    "predicates": [
        {
          "colour": "#CC0033",
          "expanded": "(TLP:RED) Information exclusively and directly
                       given to (a group of) individual recipients.
                       Sharing outside is not legitimate.",
          "value": "red"
        },
        {
          "colour": "#FFC000",
          "expanded": "(TLP:AMBER) Information exclusively given
                       to an organization; sharing limited within
                       the organization to be effectively acted upon.",
          "value": "amber"
        }...]

2.4.2.  description

   description fields MAY be used at predicates or values level to add a
   descriptive and human-readable information about the specific
   predicate or value.  The field is represented as a string.
   Implementations *_MAY_ use the description field to improve more

   contextual information.  The description at the namespace level is a
   MUST as described above.

2.4.3.  numerical_value

   numerical_value fields MAY be used at predicates or values level to
   add a machine-readable numeric value to a specific predicate or
   value.  The field is represented as JSON number.  Implementations
   SHOULD use the decimal value provided to support scoring or
   filtering.

   Example use of the numerical_value in the MISP confidence level:

              {
               "predicate": "confidence-level",
               "entry": [
                  {
                    "expanded": "Completely confident",
                    "value": "completely-confident",
                    "numerical_value": 100
                  },
                  {
                    "expanded": "Usually confident",
                    "value": "usually-confident",
                    "numerical_value": 75
                  },
                  {
                    "expanded": "Fairly confident",
                    "value": "fairly-confident",
                    "numerical_value": 50
                  },
                  {
                    "expanded": "Rarely confident",
                    "value": "rarely-confident",
                    "numerical_value": 25
                  },
                  {
                    "expanded": "Unconfident",
                    "value": "unconfident",
                    "numerical_value": 0
                  },
                  {
                    "expanded": "Confidence cannot be evaluated",
                    "value": "confidence-cannot-be-evalued"
                  }
               ]
               }

3.  Directory

   The MISP taxonomies directory is publicly available [MISP-T] in a git
   repository.  The repository contains a directory per namespace then a
   file machinetag.json which contains the taxonomy as described in the
   format above.  In the root of the repository, a MANIFEST.json exists
   containing a list of all the taxonomies.

   The MANIFEST.json file is composed of an JSON object with metadata
   like version, license, description, url and path.  A taxonomies array
   describes the taxonomy available with the description, name and
   version field.
